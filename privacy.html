<h4><strong>Your rights regarding your personal data</strong></h4>
<p><small>You have a number of rights under data protection law, which have been strengthened under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</small></p>
<p><small>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information.  You have the right to:</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Request access </strong>to your Personal Information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Request correction </strong>of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Request erasure </strong>of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Object to processing </strong>of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:</small></p>
<p><small>(a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;</small></p>
<p><small>(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</small></p>
<p><small>(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</small></p>
<p><small>(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Request the transfer </strong>of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</small></p>
<p><small>If you wish to exercise any of the rights detailed above, please use the following contact details:</small></p>
<p><small>Email: <a href="mailto:info@miggle.one">info@miggle.one</a><br />

<p><small><strong>Shortened social media links</strong></small></p>
<p><small>This website and its owners through their social media platform accounts may share web links to relevant web pages. Shortened URL’s; URL shortening is a technique used on the web to shorten URL’s (Uniform Resource Locators) to something substantially shorter. This technique is especially used in social media and looks similar to this example: https://bit.ly/2koCQUO. Users should take caution before clicking on shortened URL links and verify their authenticity before proceeding.</small></p>
<p><small>Users are advised to take caution and good judgement before clicking any shortened urls published on social media platforms by this website and its owners. Despite the best efforts to ensure only genuine urls are published many social media platforms are prone to spam and hacking and therefore this website and its owners cannot be held liable for any damages or implications caused by visiting any shortened links.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>Tracking analytics</strong></small></p>
<p><small>miggle Limited has integrated the component of Google Analytics on this website <span style="font-weight: 400;">via an additional software package called Google Tag Manager</span>. Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behaviour of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects data about the website from which a person has come (the referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimisation of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of <span style="font-weight: 400;">various forms of incoming traffic, like clicks from Google, social networks and</span> Internet advertising.</small></p>
<p><small>Google Tag Manager is a computer code management system that allows website owners to quickly and easily add snippets of code to their websites to integrate services like Google Analytics and other third-party services as referenced in this privacy policy. It doesn&#8217;t install cookies directly on visitors devices or in itself track visitors’ usage of websites.</small></p>
<p><small>Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager are services and components of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.</small></p>
<p><small>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our website, and to provide other services concerning the use of our website for us.</small></p>
<p><small>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyse the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by miggle Limited and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject (you) will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google typically gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently creates commission settlements. However, we ensure that the request which is sent to Google Analytics ensures that Google partially anonymise the IP address before it is written to disk, so that it can only be used to identify a general location rather than be used as a means to more accurately pin-point an individual user, or store an IP address, which might then be potentially used with other data to personally identify a data subject.</small></p>
<p><small>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the general location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our website, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.</small></p>
<p><small>The data subject may prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</small></p>
<p><small>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.</small></p>
