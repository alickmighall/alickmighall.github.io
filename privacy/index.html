            <h2>How and why we collect information about you</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We obtain information about you when you contact us about our products and services. We do this in order
              to be able to respond to any specific enquiries you might make. If you give us explicit permission to
              contact you beyond this, we use the information to ensure we are contacting you about products or
              resources that may be of interest to you.</p>
            <h2>What information we collect about you</h2>
            <h3>Contact information</h3>
            <p>This information is needed so we can direct you or your organisation to appropriate information regarding
              our products or services. To reduce the level of personal data we hold, you may want to supply a
              non-personal email address (for example “info@company.com”). You can request us to update or erase this
              information at any point by emailing info@miggle.co.uk. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Any information we collect will be deleted once every three months, unless a) miggle obtain explicit
              permission from you to keep your details for longer or b) you subscribe to our email newsletter. We
              collect the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Name</li>
              <li>Phone number</li>
              <li>Email address</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a small data file, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your web browser
              from a website’s computer and is stored on your device.</p>
            <p>When you visit this website, the pages and images you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your
              device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out
              whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit
              by checking for a cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
            <h4>How to control and delete cookies</h4>
            <p>We will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, if you wish to
              restrict or block the cookies which are set by this website, or indeed any other website, you can do this
              through your browser settings. Each browser is different, so check the Help menu of your browser to find
              out how to change your cookie preferences.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org which contains comprehensive information on how
              to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your
              computer as well as more general information about cookies. For information on how to do this on the
              browser of your mobile phone you will need to refer to your handset manual.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that restricting cookies may impact on the functionality of this website.</p>
